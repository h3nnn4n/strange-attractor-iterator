Strange Attractor Iterator
=========================

This code iterates thru a set of equations with several different parameter.
For each set of parameters a image is created and stacked ontop of a main image.
A function reads a color from a 1x256 P3 ppm image which is maped to each set of equations.

[My blog](http://chaotic-renan.tumblr.com/) has a lot of images generated by this code.

TODO
----

While I mostly do not make major changes to this code anymore, there is a couple of thing
which I would like to have here.

* Read a pallete from png files
* Read a pallete of any size (this one is easy =D)
* Write o a better file format (png prolly)
* An optinional graphical interface (GTK, Qt) ? No way... :)
* Recieve more useful parameters thru the command line invocation, such as:
    * Resolution
    * Brightness
    * Parameters
    * Initial condition
    * Output file
    * Coloring method
    * Pallete file (if any)
